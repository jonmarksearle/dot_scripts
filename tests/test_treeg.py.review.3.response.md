# Response — test_treeg.py.review.3

Agreements / changes applied
- Accepted the recommended invalid-input contract: all invalid inputs raise TypeError.
- Added `_fail` tests for non-iterable forest, non-Node forest items, non-Node children, and non-str names.
- Reordered tests so all failure cases appear before success cases.

Pushback
- None. The contract and ordering are clear and align with the standards.
